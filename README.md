# 🚗 Car Insurance Data Analysis

Welcome to the **Car Insurance Data** repository!  
This project focuses on analyzing car insurance customer data to uncover insights about customer behavior, claim trends, and risk factors using data science and machine learning techniques.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze car insurance data to:
- Understand key factors influencing insurance claims.
- Identify customer segments with high or low claim rates.
- Build predictive models to estimate claim probability.
- Visualize patterns in demographics, policy details, and claims.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Perform **data cleaning** and **preprocessing** of raw car insurance data.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using visualizations.
- Develop **predictive models** using machine learning (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Evaluate model performance and interpret feature importance.
- Provide actionable insights for insurance policy optimization.
